# Flight-deals-APIs
A flight deal searcher using APIs from twilio, Amadeus and Sheety. This uses sheety to decided what location you want to travel to based on a specific price you decide. Using the Amadeus APIs we can get all the flihgts and their information and if they match our criterias it will return them and if they are below the chosen price. We will receive an SMS and any member in the group will receive an email.
To make this work you will need to set up a .env file and set up all credentials for the APIs authentication.
